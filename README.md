# Metasploit Module

Metasploit is the most widely used exploitation framework. This repository covers the use of Metasploit and Meterpreter for penetration testing and post-exploitation in a safe lab environment.

---

## **Objectives**

By completing this module, you should now be able to:

- Understand the core functionality of Metasploit as an exploitation framework.  
- Generate and configure payloads using `msfvenom`.  
- Set up handlers using `msfconsole` and capture reverse shells or Meterpreter sessions.  
- Identify and exploit vulnerabilities on target systems (e.g., Windows/Linux) in a controlled environment.  
- Manage Meterpreter sessions, including backgrounding, migration, and privilege escalation.  
- Use post-exploitation modules to gather system information, enumerate users, shares, and credentials.  
- Navigate the target file system, upload/download files, and execute commands safely.  
- Understand staged vs inline payloads and select the appropriate Meterpreter version based on the target.  
- Apply ethical considerations while using Metasploit in authorized environments.

## **Reflection**

Completing this module provided a practical understanding of how Metasploit can be used for penetration testing and post-exploitation. Key takeaways include:

- **Hands-on Learning:** Seeing how Meterpreter runs in memory and avoids leaving artifacts reinforced the importance of stealth in post-exploitation.  
- **Session Management:** Migrating processes, backgrounding sessions, and using multiple sessions provided insight into maintaining control over compromised systems.  
- **Payload Knowledge:** Understanding the difference between staged and inline payloads, and choosing the right payload for the target, strengthened operational planning skills.  
- **Enumeration & Post-Exploitation:** Gathering system info, enumerating shares, and dumping hashes highlighted how attackers map networks post-compromise and why proper security controls are necessary.  
- **Ethical Awareness:** Practicing in a controlled lab environment reinforced the importance of legal and ethical guidelines in real-world scenarios.  

**Overall:** This module provided a structured, hands-on approach to mastering Metasploit and Meterpreter, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical offensive security skills.
